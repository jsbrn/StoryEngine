# StoryEngine #

This project is a text-based "choose your own adventure" game. It reads in story.txt and displays the choices, narratives, dialogues and input methods defined in the file using a custom markup language I created for my own use.

### What makes this project cool? ###

1. A custom markup language designed for creating choice-based narrative games.

### How do I try it? ###

I use the following libraries, but the project is not configured for Maven like some of my others:

1. Paulscode's SoundSystem (.wav plugin, the Java and LWJGL modules)
2. Slick2D + LWJGL 2.9.3
3. See the wiki for a brief tutorial on using the markup language.
